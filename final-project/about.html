        It's difficult to put my life story in a nutshell because it sounds completely unbelievable if I don't tell the whole thing, but for the
        sake of people with short attention spans I'm going to try. I was born in Atlanta GA and have lived here my whole life, other than the
        2.5 years I spent doing schools and mission work with Yourth With A Mission (YWAM). My mom worked with them for a few years (after she
        was paralyzed for 3 months on a respirator and miraculously healed according to her doctors) and I had the opportunity to join them
        on a trip to Monterrey, Mexico. I enjoyed having an opportunity to do something unselfish so much that I ended up spending another month there
        shortly thereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
        I then decided to pursue a degree in counseling with their university program, so I spent a year each in Switzerland
        and Germany, and two months each in South America, India, and Russia doing schools and mission trips. It was an incredible journey
        that's difficult to put into words, so if you really want to hear the rest of that story you're going to have to buy me a couple of beers.

        I got some turntables within a few months of getting back from Europe and started learning how to produce on FruityLoops and Reason before graduating
        permanently to Ableton Live. Since then I've realized that djing and production are my strongest talents and best bets when it comes to relieving sufering in this world.
        Once I learned how to mix records I started djing in midtown 2-3 times a week, and pretty soon was asked to join
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.beatport.com/label/abstract-logic-recordings/7606">Abstract Logic Recordings</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The six of us ran several very memorable weekly and monthly events and booked headliners at some of Atlanta's most established venues, including Club Shadows,
        Django, Leopard Lounge, El Bar, Graveyard Tavern, Einstein's, Five Spot, Bazaar, Crescent Room, Mood Lounge, Taverna Plaka, Spring 4th, Glenwood, and Masquerade.
        We also pulled off one of the most epic weeklies in history at Cenci in East Atlanta Village from '07-'08, complete with regular b-boy battles, theme nights,
        booty shake contests, and top notch talent on rotation. When they finally closed their doors forever, I was pretty burned out on the pressure of
        being a club promoter and decided to start a mobile dj service. That led me to eventually taking a break from djing and going back to school to pick up where I
        left off with code (so I can afford to only say yes to the gigs that aren't likely to burn me out on djing again). I've written software/websites for 4 different companies now,
        so I'm not djing your wedding for less than $3k :)
        </p>

        I'm now living somewhere that I can play music as loud/often as I please, and enjoying playing/scratching up my records as much as putting sounds together in
        the studio. I'm pretty focused on learning web development right now because I'm tossing around the idea about starting a web development business, and the intensive JavaScript
        course I just finished at <a href="http://generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> (this website was my final project) is worth every penny.
        </p>
        <p>
        That's pretty much all that's worth mentioning for now, so please do hit the <a href="contact-form/contactform.htm">contact</a>
        button if you know someone who might need a website, dj, or music teacher =]
